The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that "provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection."[2] In the OSI reference model, the communications between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.[3]

Types of Area Networks
Common types of area networks are:

LAN: Local Area Network
WAN: Wide Area Network
WLAN: Wireless Local Area Network
MAN: Metropolitan Area Network
SAN: Storage Area Network, System Area Network, Server Area Network, or sometimes Small Area Network
CAN: Campus Area Network, Controller Area Network, or sometimes Cluster Area Network
PAN: Personal Area Network
LAN and WAN are the two primary and best-known categories of area networks, while the others have emerged with technology advances.
